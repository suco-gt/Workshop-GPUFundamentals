# Workshop Part III: Application
In this section, you'll be walking through an application of GPU Programming/CUDA. In this application, you will be creating a method that generates a visualization of complex functions. Image processing is a natural extension of parallelism and GPU programming. Image processing tasks inherently involve operations on millions of pixels, where each pixel can be processed independently or in groups. This makes it an ideal candidate for GPU acceleration, leveraging thousands of threads running concurrently to dramatically reduce computation time. 

## Setup
You can navigate to the ``setup.md`` file to install dependencies and load relevant modules.

## Student Code
Navigate to the ``student_code`` directory to fill-in exercises to complete the application. If you are stuck, you can find solutions in the ``solutions`` directory.
